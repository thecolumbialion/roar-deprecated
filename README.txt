Roar is Web application based on the Flask library

What does it do?
When run, Roar will load a webpage that prompts the user to upload once the photo is uploaded.
It will then append The Columbia Lion's logo on top of the image to create a Lion wallpaper.
Depending on the setup you have, the site should return the image in ~2-3 seconds.

Where can I see a live example of this app?
It's currently running on Heroku: roar-app.herokuapp.com

What's The Columbia Lion?
The Lion is an online publication based at Columbia University. It is currently the only Columbia publication with an open submissions policy.

Future Plans:
- Make Mobile Wallpapers
- Showcase examples made by others
- Make the website nicer
